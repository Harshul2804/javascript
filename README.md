##explaination
this webpage created by me shows the hit from an api of #coindesk.com giving the rates of bitcoin
from three different places and visualise it a map taken from another api from #higcahrts.com.
the request ping is set to 1 sec,
which means after the span of every 1 sec , the html page requests for the content from the server.
